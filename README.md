# Camera Watcher

This is a Python/Flask API wrapper to manage a repository of video clips to support video machine learning experiments. In this case the video is taken from a security camera.

Clips are generated by the [Motion Project](https://github.com/Motion-Project/motion) motion binary.  

## Setup

Now, with Docker!! 

```
docker compose pull
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

## Training data

[Note: not maintained] The first task of this project is to collect training labels of the video clips. An [iPhone app](https://github.com/tomwhipple/camera-trainer) was developed which uses this framework to store results.
