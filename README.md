# Camera Watcher

This is a Python/Flask API wrapper to manage a repository of video clips to support video machine learning experiments. In this case the video is taken from a security camera.

Clips are generated by the [Motion Project](https://github.com/Motion-Project/motion) motion binary. (Initially a [Kerberos.io](https://kerberos.io/) docker image was used.) 

`motion` is a standalone binary running on a Raspberry Pi 4 which monitors the camera. When motion is detected, a video clip is generated, and a REST API call is made to this framework to record the event.

## Training data

The first task of this project is to collect training labels of the video clips. An [iPhone app](https://github.com/tomwhipple/camera-trainer) has been developed which uses this framework to store results.

## Primary Dependencies

- Python 3.9
- motion 4.4

This implementation has found success with Lighttpd and MariaDB, but specific database and web server installation is left as an excercise to the reader.
